# ADV Editor
A tool for editing and creating ADV scenes in some Illusion games. Use together with utilities [here](https://github.com/IllusionMods/IllusionModdingAPI/blob/master/doc/KKAPI.MainGame.md#eventutils) to create and run your own custom text scenarios.

This is intended only for modders and shouldn't be used by normal users.

## How to use
Install latest BepInEx, BepisPlugins and KKAPI (at least v1.18) and extract the release into your game directory.

Alternatively you can use it with the ScriptEngine plugin - clone the repository, change it to Debug, update build path to point to your game's bepinex\scripts folder, and build it.

You open the editor by default by pressing LShift + Pause. You can change this in plugin settings. Drag bottom right corner of windows to resize them.

Check the basic guide in [the wiki here](https://github.com/ManlyMarco/ADV_Editor/wiki/How-to-edit-events-with-ADV-Editor-basic-guide).

Command descriptions are editable and are saved inside bepinex\config\CommandDescriptions.txt - please submit any updates you make to these descriptions so that everyone can benefit.
